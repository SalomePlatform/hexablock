=============
Cut hexahedra
=============

This method allows to cut in two (or more) a series of hexahedra
using a series of edges propagation. This method is very useful to
connect two connexe components of hexahedra: it enables to cut a base
and to make possible the use of a "merge" to accomplish this
connexion.

To cut an hexahedra in the **Main Menu** select **Model -> Cut Hexahedra**.

**Arguments:** an edge and the number of cuts (nb).

The dialogue box for the cut of an hexahedra is:

.. image:: _static/no_cut.png

   cut
