=============
Cut hexahedra
=============

This method enables to cut in two (or more) a series of hexahedra
using a series of edges propagation. This method is very useful to
connect two connexe components of hexahedra: it enables to cut a base
and to make possible the use of a "merge" to accomplish this
connexion.

To cut an hexaedra in the **Main Menu** select **Model -> Cut hexa** 

**Arguments:** Edge + number of cuts (nb)

The dialogue box for the cut of an hexaedra is:

Example:

.. image:: _static/no_cut.png
   :align: center

.. centered::
   no cut

   cut
