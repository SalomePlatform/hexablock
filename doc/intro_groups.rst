========================================
Define the groups on the model of blocks
========================================

All groups are defined on the model of blocks.

A group is characterized by the three following components:

- its kind of group (on cells or on nodes)
- its name
- its elements

There are 3 kinds of group of cells:

- 1D cells (segments) based on edges of the model of blocks
- 2D cells (quadrangles) based on quadrangles of the model of blocks
- 3D cells (hexahedra) based on hexahedra of the model of blocks

There are 4 kinds of group of nodes that are belong:

- the vertices of the model of blocks
- the edges of the model of blocks
- the quadrangles of the model of blocks
- the hexahedra of the model of blocks
