Principle: the method by blocks
===============================

Principle
=========

The principle of the method by block is to decompose the geometry to
be meshed into a set of hexahedra related per face. The initial
geometry is divided into a new geometry which has the property to be a
set solids. All these solids are hexahedra with shared faces. Once
cutting is complete, the mesh is easy to obtain.

The method by blocks consists in:

- finding a compound of blocks,
- this compound of blocks has to be equivalent to the initial geometry to mesh.


A block is a volume defined by:

- 8 vertices
- 12 edges
    - *straight line*, *curve*
- 6 quadrangular faces
    - *planar face*, *3D face*

A compound of blocks is a volume that for each face is:

- either a free face (in one block)
- or a face shared between 2 blocks

Create a model of blocks
========================

A model of block is a compound of blocks based on a topological
definition. The model of blocks construction can be build by using the
two following methods:

1. Construct and associate blocks (hexahedra)
    - the main operations for creating blocks are:
        - Basics: create, remove,transform
        - construct hexahedra grids: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical
        
    - blocks association operations:
        - merge, cut, disconnect hexahedra 
        - prism, join quadrangles
        - merge two quadrangles of two blocks
        - merge two edges
        - merge two vertices
        - disconnect two vertices
        - create hexahedra between two existing quadrangles

2. Construct hexahedra via predefined models:
    - cylinder
    - pipe
    - two intersected cylinders
    - two intersected pipes
