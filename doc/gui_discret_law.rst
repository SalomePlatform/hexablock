A discretization law is defined by four properties:

- the name of the law
- the number of nodes for the discretization law
- the coefficient for the arithmetic and geometric law
- the kind of the law:
    - uniform (default)
    - arithmetic
    - geometric

To define a discretization law in the **Main Menu** select **Mesh -> Add Law**.

The dialogue box to create a law is:
